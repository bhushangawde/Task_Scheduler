# Task_Scheduler
A JAVA based task scheduling application

This is a mini-project which i did in the third semester of my undergraduate studies. This desktop application has been written in JAVA. The main purpose of this application is to schedule a task at a particular time. With this application, anyone can set up a few tasks like:

1. Setting a Reminder.
2. Shutting down PC
3. Playing a particular song.
4. Restarting PC
5. Opening some application.

I even added a template for scheduling an Email and an SMS to be sent at a later time using the application.
This application can be extended to support many things like sending a particular value from a the application to some ethernet based device or any microcontroller board attached to the PC on its serial interface.
